This is a project to test and use our new html, CSS skills

I would say it went really well. I definitely had to look some things up but that's good for learning.

The parts I struggled with I just asked help and everything became clear.

I learned some new about html and CSS but especially about SEO to make your site more optimal.

SEO was my lowest score at the Lighthouse test, so I added some meta and got my SEO to a 100.
